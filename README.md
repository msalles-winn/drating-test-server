# Welcome to this test

You can read this for 2 reasons : you applied for a tech job at D-Rating, or you found this project on GitHub ...

Before we read résumés, we prefer reading your source code. Please execute the TODO list and send your source code to mederic.salles@ _domain name of d-rating_. In your Email, tell us how long it took to do that, what you like and dislike in computer sciences.

Keep in mind : Everything is a test, the way you code, the way you structure your files, the way you send your source code ...


## To Do

You must conceive a REST API dealing with tourism. It contains several elements : (get,add,edit,delete) points of interests (POI), (get,add,edit,delete) points of interests' reviews, get POI's products, purshase a POI's product.

To do :
 - Create the endpoints, leave the functions as un-implemented. For exemple, `get` routes will look like 
 ```js
 {
   res.send({message: 'unimplemented'});
 }
 ```
 or better if you like.

 - Implement the endpoint which gets objects close to given coordinates. You can use Overpass API (as an example, this URL gets amenities close to coordinates, for example : `http://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data=[out:json];(node[%22amenity%22](around:2000,51.5,0.01);way[%22amenity%22](around:2000,51.5,0.01);relation[%22amenity%22](around:2000,51.5,0.01););out;%3E;`
